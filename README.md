# Gen Draw
Developed in one day in Vanilla JS, Gen Draw enables the creation of img2img (inpainting) images using the StableHorde API.

StableHorde is a crowdsourced distributed server, allowing people to create images with Stable Diffusion, a powerful deep learning model.

For a one-day project, I'm very happy with the results and it has been great fun to develop. I hope you'll enjoy drawing, entering a prompt and seeing what the AI creates!

## StableHorde API
Alongside coding and UI, I also had to spend some time getting to know the [StableHorde API](https://stablehorde.net/api/), as well as the meaning of the many parameters required when submitting an initial request. Inside [stablehordeAPI.js](https://github.com/francesconatali/gendraw/blob/main/js/stablehordeAPI.js) I annotated each parameter with comments, giving you a head-start if you wish to fine-tune the results to your liking.

Whilst StableHorde is a great free public service, it does come with its limitations: 

- I noticed that during the daytime in the USA, the service is often very busy, and it might take several minutes before your image is finally rendered.
- Each request to generate an image has a 'weight', the more demanding your request is, the higher its 'weight' will be. Especially when using the anonymous/public API key ("0000000000"), the image generation is capped to a certain 'weight', which means more demanding requests are ignored/dropped. The current settings in Gen Draw are being finely tuned to get the most out of this 'weight' allowance from StableHorde.

## Type of Processing

While generating an image starting from another image is often simply called 'img2img', in reality this comes in 3 different flavours:

- Img2Img: Transforms an input image into a different style or appearance while maintaining its original structure.
- Inpainting: Fills in missing or removed parts of an image based on the surrounding context.
- Outpainting: Expands the edges of an image to create a larger canvas, continuing the original image's style and content.

In the context of Gen Draw, due to the minimalistic and 'sketchy' nature of an image drawn on HTML canvas, I opted for "Inpainting". You can see this on line 24 in stablehordeAPI.js:  `source_processing: "inpainting"`.

I hope you'll enjoy using Gen Draw, and if you fork it and improve it, let me know! ðŸ™‹
