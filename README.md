# Gen Draw
Generate img2img _(inpainting)_ images via StableHorde API.

Coded in Vanilla JS, Gen Draw is a one-day project, started in the morning and completed by the evening _(and I had to dedicate a meaningful amount of time to getting to know StableHorde APIs and all the many parameters to fine-tune the image generation)_.

An app like this can lend itself to be expanded in all directions, implementing all sorts of fancy features. But for the time being, it is simple and minimal.
